\title{ SEER and A-Bomb Data Analysis Tools }
\description{Creates SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) and Japanese A-bomb survivor data binaries 
             from ASCII sources and provides tools for estimating SEER second cancer risks.     
Depicted below, \code{mkSEER}
merges cancers and populations of all three of the SEER databases into single cancer and 
population data frames.

SEER data field positions and names change over the years and the original purpose of  
SEERaBomb was to buffer/protect R scripts from such changes. A second purpose was to speed up SEER data computations by 
reducing the data [via \code{pickFields()}] to only fields of interest. SEERaBomb now has an additional purpose:
estimating relative risks of SEER second cancers after diagnoses of first cancers, using all three SEER databases.

\note{The old version of mkSEER() merged cancer files but it didn't merge databases. 
To avoid breaking scripts that expect separate databases, that old version is still available, but it is now called mkSEERold. 

Initial development of SEERaBomb was supported by the National Cancer Institute and Tufts Integrative 
Cancer Biology Program under U54CA149233-029689. As of 2014, maintenance and further 
development has been supported by the Cleveland Clinic Foundation.}
