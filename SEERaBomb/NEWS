CHANGES IN VERSION 2014.10.1 (first new version of October 2014)
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o planning to add two-dimensional spline fits to age and calendar year.    

    o mapCancs is now called within mkSEER to make a cancer field in those files as well.  

Notes

    o published paper scripts now use the cancer field instead of histo2 (which is no longer included in pickfields by default) and 
      plots now also use quartz() when on a mac. The courses folder is now called examples; these scripts were also updated
      and some were removed.

------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o added US 2000 populations as 19-, 86-, and 100-age group data.frames.

    o added mkHema87() to convert RERF file HEMA87.DAT into a binary with column names

    o sq vs ad lung incidence and survival added to doc/courses

    o old demos are now examples in doc/courses

CHANGES IN VERSION 2013.4.1
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Now handles SEER data release of April 24, 2013

    o Package version number now matches latest SEER release date.


SIGNIFICANT USER-LEVEL CHANGES

    o No longer handles SEER data released in 2012.

Notes

    o The SEER SAS file changed: fields are no longer a continuum.  
      The implication is that getFields is now field name centric, since 
      I can no longer count on all fields being in the SAS file.
      
    o Survival is now already in months in SEER, so mapping it is no longer needed. 
      Indeed, the SAS file no longer includes a field for survival with years and 
      months as two character strings in a field of 4 chars, though this field does
      still remain in the SEER data files. 


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.3.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o eod13 and eod2 are now set to strings in pickFields to avoid errors when picked
