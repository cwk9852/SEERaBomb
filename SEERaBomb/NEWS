CHANGES IN VERSION 2015.2 (Second version working with the SEER release of 2015)
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o The function tsd now takes a firstS argument, a verctor of first cancers of interest. This doesn't speed things 
      up much but it makes the output of tst easier to read and the output of mkExcel much more focused. 

    o The latest National Vital Statistics Report data is now included as a data.frame.  


CHANGES IN VERSION 2015.1 (First version working with the SEER release of 2015)
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o simSeerSet simulates a seerSet class object for two cancer types, A and B. 

    o mkSEER (mkSEER2->mkSEER and mkSEER>-mkSEERold) uses stdUS 2000 to extend single age popsa to popsae. It also 
      makes a trt column for radiation therapy by default.


Notes
    o random crashes from the C++ code have been debugged. Variants of fillPYM in straight C and R used to debug it
      are now in the folder doc/extraFuncs




CHANGES IN VERSION 2014.3 
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o added seetSet to make objects of class seerSet for the pipeline seerSet->mk2D->tsd.    

    o added mk2D that makes two-dimensional spline fits of incidence versus age and calendar year and plot2D to look at them.    

    o added tsd to compute RR over various time since diagnosis intervals
      and mkExcel to look at the results.

    o added helper functions: getBinInfo, getPY, post1PYO, getE    

    o mapCancs is now called within mkSEER to make a cancer field in those files as well.  

Notes
    o Month is no longer in the package version number and year now reflects the SEER data release year rather than the SEERaBomb release year.    

    o published paper scripts now use the cancer field instead of histo2 (which is no longer included in pickfields by default) and  plots now also use quartz() when on a mac. The old courses folder is now called examples; scripts therein were updated
      and some were removed. 


CHANGES IN VERSION 2014.4.2
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o added US 2000 populations as 19-, 86-, and 100-age group data.frames.    

    o created mkSEER2 to create pooled db files directly into e.g. ~\data\SEER\mrgd  


SIGNIFICANT USER-LEVEL CHANGES

    o mkHema87 was removed. Its functionality is now included in mkAbomb

Notes

    o fixed pickFields() to make country and state of birth strings rather than integers



CHANGES IN VERSION 2014.4.1
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o changed default seerHome directory to ~\data\SEER to no longer assume admin rights

    o updated 2010 to 2011 in mkSEER and in several help pages to match April 15,2014 SEER release

    o changed mkSEER SQL default to TRUE 

    o added pops single ages (popsa) to binary files and all.db  



CHANGES IN VERSION 2013.4.3
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o added mkAbomb() to convert RERF file lsshempy.csv into a binary and SQLite database

    o added mkHema87() to convert RERF file HEMA87.DAT into a binary with column names

    o sq vs ad lung incidence and survival added to doc/courses

    o JCO 2013 survival plots added to doc/papers/JCO2013

    o activeMS is now doc/papers/radiatEnvironBiophys2013

SIGNIFICANT USER-LEVEL CHANGES

    o old demos are now examples in doc/courses

Notes

    o vignettes are not possible since SEER and Abomb data must be signed off on. 



CHANGES IN VERSION 2013.4.1
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Now handles SEER data release of April 24, 2013

    o Package version number now matches latest SEER release date.


SIGNIFICANT USER-LEVEL CHANGES

    o No longer handles SEER data released in 2012.

Notes

    o The SEER SAS file changed: fields are no longer a continuum.  
      The implication is that getFields is now field name centric, since 
      I can no longer count on all fields being in the SAS file.
      
    o Survival is now already in months in SEER, so mapping it is no longer needed. 
      Indeed, the SAS file no longer includes a field for survival with years and 
      months as two character strings in a field of 4 chars, though this field does
      still remain in the SEER data files. 


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.3.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o eod13 and eod2 are now set to strings in pickFields to avoid errors when picked
